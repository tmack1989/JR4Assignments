    <h1>Troy Mack's Cover Letter</h1>
        <p>This is where I would type a paragraph explaining exactly what kind of job I'm looking
            for & describe some of my talents or skills. It would also probably be a good idea to
            explain why I would be a good candidate for such & such job, all of that good stuff.
            I hope this is what the assignment is suppose to be because I haven't worked on a 
            cover letter really before now.
        </p>
